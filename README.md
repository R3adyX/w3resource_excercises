Csharp exercises by w3reources
Working on mastering my first progrmaing languge. Though I have learned some of the basics of other languages, i realized what 
I wanted to do is create desktop applications and games which both can be acomplished easly with tools utilizing C#.

My main focus is learning the basics of c# and filling the gaps in my knowledge by rewatching tutorial videos and doing
csharp challenges to progress my knowledge and skill.
